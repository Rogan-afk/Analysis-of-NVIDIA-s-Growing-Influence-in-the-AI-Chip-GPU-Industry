This study delves into the ascent of NVIDIA to its current position, where it monopolizes the discrete
GPU market. What factors have contributed to NVIDIA’s tremendous success? Additional questions
explored include:
• Is there a correlation between bitcoin values (from 2016 to 2022) and NVIDIA’s graphics share
prices during that time period? Conclusions drawn from this correlation will be discussed.
• Comparison of stock prices for AMD and NVIDIA. How did NVIDIA outscale its rival, AMD?
AI growth accelerated from 2019 to 2023, coinciding with NVIDIA’s sales growth.
• Prediction analysis of NVIDIA’s most popular graphics card in the midrange price segment of
the next-gen graphics cards (RTX 50XX series and RTX 60XX series).
